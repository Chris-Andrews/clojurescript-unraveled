This chapter will cover a little introduction to existing tooling for making things easy when
developing using ClojureScript. It will cover:

* Using the repl
* Leiningen and cljsbuild
* Google Closure Library
* Modules

== Mixed Bag

This chapter will cover miscelaneous topics that are not classified in the previous ones. This is a
"catchall" section and will touch a bunch of heterogeneus topics like:

* Async primitives using _core.async_ library.
* Working with promises.
* Error handling using _cats_ library.
* Pattern matching with _core.match_ library.
* Web development using Om library.
* Share code betwen clojure and clojurescript.
