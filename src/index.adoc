== About this book

This book covers the ClojureScript programming language, serves as a detailed guide of its
tooling for development, and presents a series of articles about topics that are
applicable to day-to-day programming in ClojureScript.

It is not an introductory book to programming in that it assumes the reader has experience
programming in at least one language. However, it doesn't assume experience with
_ClojureScript_ or functional programming. We'll try to include links to reference
material when talking about the theoretical underpinnings of ClojureScript that may not
be familiar to everyone.

Since the ClojureScript documentation is good but sparse, we wanted to write a compendium
of reference information and extensive examples to serve as a ClojureScript primer as
well as a series of practical how-to's. This document will evolve with the ClojureScript
language, both as a reference of the language features and as a sort of cookbook with
xpractical programming recipes.

You'll get the most ouf this book if you:

- are curious about ClojureScript or functional programming and have some programming
  experience;
- write JavaScript or any other language that compiles to it and want to know what
  ClojureScript has to offer;
- already know some Clojure and want to learn how ClojureScript differs from it, plus
  practical topics like how to target both languages with the same code base.

Don't be turned off if you don't see yourself in any of the above groups. We encourage
you to give this book a try and to give us feedback on how we can make it more accessible.
Our goal is to make ClojureScript more friendly to newcomers and spread the ideas about
programming that Clojure has helped popularize, as we see a lot of value in them.


== Introduction

This chapter is an introduction to the Clojure ecosystem and intends to explain the
philosophy behind it.

include::philosophy.adoc[]


== Language (the basics)

This chapter will be a little introduction to ClojureScript without assumptions about
previous knowledge of the Clojure language, providing a quick tour over all the things
you will need to know about clojurescript and understand the rest of this book.

== Tooling & Compiler

This chapter will cover a little introduction to existing tooling for making things easy
when developing using ClojureScript. It will cover:

* Using the repl
* Leiningen and cljsbuild
* Google Closure Library
* Modules
* Unit testing
* Library development
* Browser based development
* Server based development

Unlike the previous chapter, this chapter intends to tell different stories each
independent of the other.

== Language (advanced topics)

This chapter intends to explain some advanced topics that are part of the language and
that does not fits in the first chapter. The good candidates for this section are
transducers, core protocols, transients, metadata. In summary: topics that are not
mandatory for understand the language.

== Mixed Bag

This chapter will cover miscellaneous topics that are not classified in the previous ones.
This is a "catchall" section and will touch on a bunch of heterogeneous topics like:

* Repl based development with figwheel.
* Working with promises.
* Error handling using the _cats_ library.
* Pattern matching with the _core.match_ library.
* Web development using the Om library.
* Share code between Clojure and ClojureScript.
