# ClojureScript Unraveled #

[![](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by-sa/4.0/80x15.png "License")](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

An open source ClojureScript book. Read it [here](http://funcool.github.io/clojurescript-unraveled/).

This books aims to serve as:
- A comprehensive introduction to the ClojureScript language and its idiomatic usage,
  assuming no previous experience with Clojure or functional programming;
- a detailed guide of the ClojureScript compiler and the tooling around it; and
- a mixed bag of topics that are useful in day-to-day ClojureScript programming.

As such, it is divided into three main sections: Language, Tooling & Compiler, and
Mixed Bag.


## Status ##

At this moment the book is still being written and is mostly incomplete.

We are not native English speakers, so language improvements and typo fixes are very, very
welcome!


## How to Contribute ##

This is a quick and dirty FAQ:

- If you found some typo or wording improvements (that do not imply any structural
  changes) open a pull-request directly.
- If you want to propose a new chapter, please open an issue for discussing it.
- If you want to propose a structural change, please open an issue for discussing it.
- If you want to suggest an additional topic, please open an issue for discussing it.

Please, maintain the commit size small for easy commits picking.


**Rules for text formatting**:

- Use correct asciidoctor syntax.
- Max line width should be 89 chars.


**General note**:

At this moment, we do not have plans to accept new chapters until the the basic book
structure is finished. This is not because we don't want to, but because it's very
difficult to handle that at this stage of the book. That being said, proposals are very
welcome.
